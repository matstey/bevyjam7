## Idea

* WarioWare style mini games
* Randomly switching between games
    * Picks up where you left off
    * Playing multiple games at once
* Different art styles per game
* No character. More screen based interactions.
* Body temperature lowers the better you are doing.
    * High temp = louder/faster music and visual effects.

## How to play

You will be present with a variety of mini games. Before the game begins you will be shown the control method and given a single word hint of what you need to do. Games are pass of fail. You need to keep going for as many rounds as possible. Your fever temperature will increase as you fail mini games. When your temperate gets too high the game will end.
