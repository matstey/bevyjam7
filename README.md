## Ideas

* WarioWare style mini games
* Randomly switching between games
    * Picks up where u left off
    * Playing multiple games at once
* Different art styles per game
* No character. More screen based interactions.
* Body temperature lowers the better you are doing.
    * High temp = louder/faster music and visual effects.

##

* Crate per mini game?
* Load all assets on startup
* Share assets between mini games
* Just a start button
* Volume mute
* Lives
    * 5 lives
    * Scale between 37C and 42C. 42C == game over
    * Games are pass or fail
    * Failed game == 1 life lost
    * Passed game life regained by .5
* Pre game screen
    * Display controls for next game
    * Temperature/lives update
    * Display round
* Music
    * All moving and pulsing things to be in tempo with music
    * Layered tracks
    * Tempo and aggression increase with rounds/time
