## Ideas

* WarioWare style mini games
* Randomly switching between games
    * Picks up where u left off
    * Playing multiple games at once
* Different art styles per game
* No character. More screen based interactions.
* Body temperature lowers the better you are doing.
    * High temp = louder/faster music and visual effects.

##

* Crate per mini game?
* Load all assets on startup
* Share assets between mini games
* Just a start button
* Volume mute
